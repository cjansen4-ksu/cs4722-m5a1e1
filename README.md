## Module 05 - Assignment 01 - Exercise 01

I'm providing my code from this particular exercise because the button handlers were a pain for anyone who wasn't in class when he explained them. He also said you'll also need all the key-handling code going forward.

### Note

I know the code he provides uses the *keycode* property, but this is being depreciated, [as seen here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode)

Instead, I use the newer *key* property and provide the *key* names for each key. If you need to find the proper name for a key, you can find it by using the **Try It Out** element [on this MDN Docs page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code).
